# Todos ~ Dynamic web application

Developed a persistent Todos application with full CRUD functionality to manage a list of tasks.

-> Displayed the Todo-List using HTML list elements and enhanced its appearance with CSS and Bootstrap. <br/>
-> Implemented CRUD operations through JavaScript event listeners, dynamically updating the UI using JavaScript DOM manipulation. <br/>
-> Utilized arrays, objects, and their methods to perform CRUD operations on the Todo-List, ensuring the state is maintained across page reload with local storage.
